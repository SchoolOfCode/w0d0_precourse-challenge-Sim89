# This is my tribute page to Michael Jackson. 

I chose this subject because firstly, i'm a big fan of Michael Jackson and secondly I love all of his music hits.

After doing this project, I have learnt how to use basic HTML to build a webpage as well as CSS to complete the design of the document.

Reflecting from this piece of work, I would definately like to focus working on improving my skills in CSS as I feel I could have done a lot more design work in this project.
